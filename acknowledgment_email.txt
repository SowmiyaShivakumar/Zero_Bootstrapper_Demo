Subject: Repository Update Status

Dear Sowmiya,

I wanted to update you regarding the implementation of the ecommerce system in the Git repository. Currently, we have encountered a couple of technical issues:

1. **GitHub Token Issue**: There was a problem with the GitHub token not being provided during the operation, which has prevented us from successfully cloning and pushing changes.

2. **Validation Errors**: Subsequent attempts produced validation errors indicating that some inputs that should be strings were mistakenly passed as integers. This needs to be addressed before we can proceed.

### Next Actions
I will:
- Ensure the GitHub token is correctly configured and formatted.
- Review and refactor the code to address the content length validation errors.
- Retry the cloning of the repository, the creation of the `ecommerce` branch, and the push of the new functionalities.

Once these issues are resolved and actions completed, I will send you an acknowledgment email confirming the updates.

If you have any further instructions or need assistance on your end, please let me know.

Best regards,
